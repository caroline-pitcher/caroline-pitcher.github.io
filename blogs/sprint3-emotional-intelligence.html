        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence</h2>
            <p>
                Emotional intelligence is how we understand and manage our own emotions and our ability to relate to other people and their emotions through empathy. If someone can <ol>
                    <li>identify their own emotions, control and manage them appropriately, and is also good at</li>
                    <li>identifying other people’s emotions and communicating with them using that knowledge,</li>
                </ol>
                then we say that person has a lot of emotional intelligence or a high EI score. Some people naturally have a lot of emotional intelligence but people with less emotional intelligence can still build up their skills.
            </p>
        <h2>How it is different to IQ</h2>
            <p>
                IQ is about intelligence but not about how well we relate to people or our sense of empathy. Ideally an IQ test shows how well we reason, our memory skills and our ability to process visual and spatial cues. An IQ score is developed by dividing our mental age score by our chronological age. However in practice IQ tests can often be biased based on the test-taker’s race and sex. IQ tests have also often been used to discriminate against disabled people.
            </p>
        <h2>Why it is important</h2>
            <p>
                Having a high amount of emotional intelligence means we can connect to people more easily and communicate with them. If we feel that someone understands and empathises with us, we are much more likely to trust them and like them.
