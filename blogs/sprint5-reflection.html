        <h2>Three new things I have learned about myself and my ego as a result of the core learning</h2>
            <p>
                I think I limited myself before this by thinking that we all have some hard wired skills and they were fixed. I definitely believed in the ability we have to learn new things but I didn’t realise how much more was possible, that we can all develop our skills and the our brains will support us. In terms of ego I do prefer to be the one who knows things and helps other people, and it is always a bit harder to be the one being taught who knows less. That said, I do really enjoy learning, it’s fun! It’s worth feeling a bit lost at times and like a novice to gain more skills and knowledge. The thing I most disliked about school and university was not the learning part but the having to regurgitate it in a fixed way in order to advance through courses. I really prefer the idea of doing something with what you’ve learned and what skills you’ve developed, not just showing the ability to memorise things. The other experience this course is reminding me of at the moment is the experience of learning to drive as an adult (in a manual car). It took me a long time to learn, mainly because I had a lot of anxiety about it, and everyone kept telling me at some point all the things you’ve learned will come together and it will start feeling natural but I started to doubt that would ever happen for me. And then it eventually did! At the moment I feel like I know a lot of bits of JavaScript but the overall thing hasn’t come together for me so I’m hoping I get to that point with JS. It helps to remind myself that lots of things I didn’t know how to do a month ago now feel very natural and second nature to me.

        <h2>The role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming</h2>
            <p>
                I believe that programming and algorithms have a lot of power over us and our daily lives that we are not aware of. It is so important that programmers and developers are from all different backgrounds, and have a strong sense of our values and the ability to empathise. There are so many real world examples of tech being developed that never allowed for the possibility of people of different races using it, or allowed for the experiences of those who weren’t developing it. The future of tech needs to be better than it has been. In terms of learning as well, if you don’t have a sense of yourself and what values are important to you, and how that differs or is similar to others, your learning will inevitably be very closed off and stunted. It won’t allow for all the possibilities and ideas that could improve the world, and will be lacking because of it.

        <h2>What most surprised me about the core learning</h2>
            <p>
                I think because many of the concepts of the core are somewhat familiar to me, at times doing the core learning could feel like a bit of a chore. When I’m really enjoying doing the tech part it becomes hard to sit down and think about something quite different like my identity. That said I always get a lot out of doing the core learning and usually end up enjoying it. It’s the sort of thing where the doing of it actually helps you a lot more than you think it will.
            </p>
        <h2>The most challenging aspects of the core learning</h2>
            <p>
                Again probably just forcing myself to get started with it, once I got going I usually did enjoy it and the ideas start to flow a bit more freely.
            </p>
        <h2>Why I think a programming school is spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course</h2>
            <p>
                Ultimately we are never going to be able to learn every single thing about code or all the coding languages over the course because that would literally take years. So I think the result of the bootcamp is not that we all become the most knowledgeable web developers ever but that we become web developers who know how to learn things, who know ourselves and how we can constantly improve. Most hiring managers would much rather have someone who can learn and is easy to work with than someone who is has lots of knowledge but doesn’t want to learn anything new and has fixed ways of working they don’t want to change.
            </p>
        <h2>Does the time I spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time and should I have just used that time to practicing programming instead</h2>
            <p>
                No, it definitely doesn’t feel like a waste of time. A lot of the core stuff was more familiar to me than the programming stuff as I hadn’t had much experience coding before this, but I still got heaps out of doing the core exercises. And there’s always going to be more coding to learn, I doubt anyone on earth knows everything there is to know about every coding language, especially since there is new tech being made all the time. I’m glad to have spent this time on concepts and thoughts other than code and I think it has helped me feel more confident and balanced.
