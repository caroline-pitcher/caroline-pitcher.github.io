    <h1>Identity, Values and Strength</h1>
    <div class="blogs">
        <h2>Core personal values</h2>
            <p>
                The most core values for me are kindness and truth. I would also say independence and freedom are very important to me. I think communication is vital especially that everyone feels heard & understood. It’s also important to focus on the ideas of those who are marginalised in our society as they are less heard and yet so often those with the best ideas.
            </p>
        <h2>An ethical decision</h2>
            <p>
                One time I was left in charge of the Central Library during an evening shift and one of the staff came up to my desk with a teenage girl who had been harassed by another patron. The patron had basically kept trying to hit on her and wouldn’t leave her alone. As the person in charge I had to speak with him and part of the procedure for trespassing someone from the library is we had to give them a particular warning and information the first time they break the library rules. It was difficult to put my personal feelings of anger and empathy for the teenage girl aside and speak with the patron calmly and professionally about the fact that his behaviour was inappropriate and warn him that he would be trespassed from the library if he continued to behave this way towards other patrons. I felt conscious that I was a representative of the library and couldn’t simply say what I wanted to say to him or treat him the way I would have if I wasn’t at work. He also was extremely savvy and threatened to both sue me and complain about me to his consulate. Even though I knew he probably couldn’t do any harm to me legally it was still very worrying. Eventually he left and my colleague who had asked for my help praised me for how I acted and said I had been very calm and professional. That was great as I had definitely not felt calm inside!
            </p>
        <h2>Culural influences</h2>
            <p>
                I think the culture of NZ is pretty similar to my own personality, it’s hard to know how much was inbuilt in me and how much was influenced by the culture I grew up in. The core facets to me of NZ culture are “the number 8 wire” mentality of figuring out a problem in whatever unconventional way works. Kiwis are also hardworking, pretty direct and love deadpan humour and that’s fairly similar to me I think. I care a lot about the environment, which is an important value for New Zealanders; and I enjoy knowing lots of different people from all different backgrounds which is pretty common in Auckland especially.
            </p>
        <h2>Strengths and limitations</h2>
            <p>
                My strengths are that I learn quickly, I’m a good communicator, I work hard and I enjoy working in a team. I really enjoy learning new things so I’m always looking for exciting projects I can get involved in. I’ve always been pretty valued in jobs for those skills but sometimes my limitations have held me back from developing my career. My limitations are I get bored pretty easily so I’m always looking for something new and different and I’m not always good at time management as I can easily spend hours on something or get distracted in the middle of a task and forget what I was doing. I also don’t like rules that I can’t see the point of, micromanaging and power hierarchies so that doesn’t always go down well with some workplaces.
            </p>
        <h2>Strengths and my learning journey</h2>
            <p>
                I think my strengths in communication and learning quickly will be especially helpful. I consider myself a life long learner so I think a career where you are always learning new programming languages or new ways of doing things will suit me well.
            </p>
        <h2>An experience working with others</h2>
            <p>
                I’ve worked on teams with some people who I had personality clashes or disagreements with and it is difficult. The strategies I used were to stay calm and try and see things from their angle. I find it’s important to remember that if two people are arguing over something it’s usually because they care deeply about the project and that’s a good thing. They are passionate about their work ultimately, they just have different perspectives. This strategy worked reasonably well though now I would probably tell myself to let it go if it is something minor. Sometimes I have ended up picking a hill to die on which in retrospect wasn’t something important. It’s good to focus in on what’s genuinely necessary and important and what aspects I can give up without changing the overall outcome.
