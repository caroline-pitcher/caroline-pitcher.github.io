    <title>Sprint 2: Learning Plan</title>
</head>

    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
    <div class="blogs">
        <h2>Career pathway</h2>
            <p>
                Ideally my long term goal is working as a web developer remotely. If not remotely then I would like to work somewhere with flexible working so I can choose my hours somewhat. I haven’t really got beyond web developer in my head but if I enjoy the work I would love to work my way up in a company for a bit. Another long term plan is to be self-employed or contracting, something where I have a bit more control over my own career.
            </p>
        <h2>Human skills</h2>
            <p>
                I would like to develop more self-confidence in my abilities and more resilience to anxiety. Also I am constantly working on my time management.
            </p>
        <h2>Strengths and limitations</h2>
            <p>
                Areas I am strong in are communication and working with others in person. I am fairly empathetic and usually get on with everyone. I am a pretty fast learner, it’s helpful that I can read fast and absorb information quickly. I can be a good leader but I prefer not to do it too much. I work well both in teams and by myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                My limitations are I’m not great at sticking to schedules and knowing how much time it will take me to do something so sometimes deadlines can sneak up on me. I’m not really a morning person either. If I’m interested in something I tend to want to keep going regardless of tiredness, hunger, etc. I am affected somewhat by loud noises and bright lights but can still work in environments like that. I’m also a bit sensitive to emotion so people having arguments around me throws me off. I sometimes lack confidence in my abilities.
            </p>
        <h2>My commitment to managing my workload</h2>
            <p>
                My commitment to myself is that I will remind myself to take breaks when needed, to get food and take a walk or rest. I will be easy on myself if the environment is stressful for me, maybe use headphones or take a break outside. I will use outside timers like toggl or my phone to help me stay on top of time deadlines. I will be gentle with myself and others when it’s not my ideal environment to work in or not my ideal time to work.
            </p>
        <h2>My commitment to seeking help</h2>
            <p>
                I will reach out to help from my facilitator and my cohort when I am feeling overloaded and starting to struggle. If I need to speak up about my own needs in a group project I will do so. If I am running behind a deadline I will talk to my facilitator asap about it, I will set some reminders in my phone for myself to help with this.
            </p>
        <h2>Expectations from facilitators</h2>
            <p>
                Transparency with how I’m doing in the course especially with sticking to deadlines, and kindness for when I’m struggling or having a hard day. I prefer people to be direct and honest with me if I have done something wrong so I can fix it.
            </p>
        <h2>Scheduling information</h2>
            <p>
                I don’t have any scheduling conflicts at the moment but will add something in or make the facilitators aware if it comes up.
