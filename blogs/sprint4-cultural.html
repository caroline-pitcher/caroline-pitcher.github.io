        <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
            <h2>How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h2>
                <p>
                    It helps people understand that there isn’t a limit to what their brain can achieve as the brain is constantly changing and developing. If you start learning something and keep practicing it your brain will develop new pathways and connections and make them stronger. If you stop doing something, after a while your brain will prune those connections. Neuroplasticity helps remove the limits we put on ourselves and even if something has affected your brain like a physical or mental illness or injury, it can help you rebuild and develop new brain patterns.
                </p>
            <h2>How I might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for my own benefit</h2>
                <p>
                    was somewhat aware of neuroplasticity before this but doing this course has made it clear for me that I can learn new things relatively quickly but I need to keep practicing them otherwise my brain will stop remembering them fairly quickly. If I practise and keep using what I’ve learned it sticks around for a lot longer.
                </p>
            <h2>What are some of the ways to increase my neuroplasticity</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/neuroplasticity/">This article</a>> suggests several things that I think are helpful under ‘How to Rewire Your Brain with Neuroplasticity’. Reading fiction (it’s first because it’s my favourite!), travellling, learning a musical instrument and creating artwork are probably the ones that most appeal to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also as I have depression and anxiety I read the ‘8 Neuroplasticity Exercises for Anxiety and Depression’ from the same <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/neuroplasticity/">link</a> which are:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Learning to juggle</li>
                        <li>Learning to play a new instrument</li>
                        <li>Learning a new language</li>
                        <li>Yoga</li>
                        <li>Mild to moderate regular exercise</li>
                        <li>Challenging brain activities like crosswords or sudoku</li>
                        <li>Learning a new subject—especially a large, complex subject in a short period of time (Hellerstein, 2011)</li>
                    </ol>
                    And I’m pleased to say that this course counts as both 3 and 7 for me so that’s good!
                </p>
            <h2>Link to a resource that I found particularly useful or engaging</h2>
                <p>
                  <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/neuroplasticity/">This article</a> I mentioned earlier was definitely interesting. And <a href="https://edgefoundation.org/adhd-and-the-neuroplastic-brain/ ">this article</a> as I also have ADHD, particularly the connection with positive stimuli. ADHD can often mean feeling like a failure or like you can’t do what everyone else can do. I have definitely found focusing on things I can do and feel positive about makes everything easier for me and I’m more likely to keep trying with the things I find difficult.
                </p>
            <h2>What is Growth Mindset and why is it relevant</h2>
                <p>
                    It’s similar to neuroplasticity in that it says there is no limit on what you can learn or achieve, or rather the limit is one you have placed on yourself if you have a fixed mindset. A growth mindset means that you believe you are capable of improvement, that you can learn something and get better at it at any time. A fixed mindset is one where you think you either have an innate trait or talent for something or you don’t and that’s it, there is no possibility of change or growth.
                </p>
            <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise me or change for me</h2>
                <p>
                    It was helpful to realise you can have a growth mindset in some things but a fixed mindset in others. I generally feel I do have a growth mindset in what I feel I can achieve but looking at some areas I realised I did have a fixed mindset in that I didn’t think I could ever improve in those areas.
                </p>
            <h2>How I will integrate growth mindset into your learning journey</h2>
                <p>
                    I think I already have somewhat of a growth mindset towards the course as this is an area I believed I could learn and improve in, and I have improved even in this short period of time. I think it will be helpful in encouraging myself to practice more as that will help me get better, especially if it’s something that I find really difficult on the first go. I also found this interesting in the <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/the-habits-of-successful-people-they-have-a-growth-mindset/">resource.</a> “Confidence is displayed ability” so it’s ok not to feel confident, you can just try and do something  and you may well be able to do it, you don’t know until you try and keep trying.

            <h2>Link to a resource that I found particularly useful or engaging</h2>
                <p>
                  <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">This article</a> was helpful in that it was a deeper dive into growth mindset and also <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/861739/17-ways-to-develop-a-growth-mindset">this one.</a> I think what stood out for me is how praise isn’t always a good thing and it’s better not to look for approval all the time. This is definitely a struggle for me so it’s helpful to remind myself that praise is ultimately not that helpful and it’s more important to keep learning and trying. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h4GD2feZ8Q">This video </a>is very relatable for me haha
