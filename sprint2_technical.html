        <h1>What is the difference between Margin, Border and Padding?</h1>
        <img src="https://photos.app.goo.gl/1z6iGNc3HPUKWyf37" alt="Margins, border and padding">
        <h2>Border</h2>
        <p>The border of an element is a line around your element. You have the options to change the colour of the border, the width of the border, what side of the element it is on and whether the border is solid, dotted, etc. You can also make a border rounded so instead of looking like a rectangle or square if looks more like an oval.</p>
        <h2>Margin</h2>
        <p>The margin is the space around an element on the page. The margin is outside the border. You can alter the top, bottom, right and left margins to change the way your page looks. You cannot change the colour of a margin, it will stay the same as the background colour. You can also create a negative margin which will overlay different elements on top of one another.</p>
        <h2>Padding</h2>
        <p>The padding is the space inside an element between the content and the border. The padding is inside the border. You can alter the top, bottom, right and left padding to change the way your page looks. You can change the colour of your padding so that individual elements have different background colours.</p>
